Securethelogs.ps1 is the all in one script! 

It contains all of my scripts and allows remote execution of them all.

You can either run locally or by running: 

powershell –nop –c “iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securethelogs/Securethelogs/master/securethelogs.ps1’)”

For any feedback or comments, speak to me on Twitter: @securethelogs

Enjoy! :)
